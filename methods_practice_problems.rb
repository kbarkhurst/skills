# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# puts "Type a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.
# puts "Type a number"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# if number > 100
#   puts "That's a big number"
# else
#   puts "Your number is #{number}"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.
# puts "Provide a number"
# number1 = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts "Provide another number"
# number2 = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts number1 + number2


# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.
# puts "Provide a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts "Your word printed backwards is #{word.reverse}."

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.
# puts "Enter a number"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# 10.times do 
#   puts number
# end

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.
# puts "Type a word"
# word1 = gets.chomp
# puts "Type another word"
# word2 = gets.chomp
# puts "#{word1.upcase} #{word2.upcase}"

# # 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.
# puts "Enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts "Your word is #{word.length} letters long."

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.
# puts "Enter a number"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# if number < 0
#   puts "That's a negative number."
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.
# puts "Enter a number"
# number1 = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts "Enter another number"
# number2 = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts number1 * number2

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.
# puts "Enter a word"
# word_length = gets.chomp.length
# if word_length > 5
#   puts "That's a long word"
# end
