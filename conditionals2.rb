# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

# variable = 10
# if variable == 10
#   puts "0 because the number is equal to 10"
# else
#   puts "-1 because the number is not 10"
# end

# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# variable = 12
# if variable < 10
#   puts "-1"
# elsif variable > 10
#   puts "1"
# elsif variable == 10

# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.
# variable1 = 9
# variable2 = 7
# if variable1 < 10 && variable2 < 10
#   puts "Both less than 10, #1"
# else
#   puts "Not both less than 10, #0"

# 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.
# variable = 0
# if variable > 9000
#   puts "Over 9000 prints 1"
# else
#   puts "Not over 9,000 prints -1"
# end

# 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).
# variable = 29
# if variable < 10
#   puts "#{variable} is less than 10, prints 9"
# elsif variable < 20
#   puts "19 because #{variable} is less than 20"
# elsif variable < 30
#   puts "29 because #{variable} is less than 30."
# else
#   puts "-1"
# end

# 6. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.
# variable1 = 2
# variable2 = 3
# if variable1 > 10 || variable2 > 10
#   puts "One of the numbers is greater than 10, puts 100"
# else
#   puts "-100"
# end

# 7. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1776 if the number is less than 0, and prints 1979 otherwise.

# variable = 3
# if variable < 0
#   puts "1776"
# else
#   puts "1979"
# end

# 8. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.
# variable = 3
# if variable == 100
#   puts "100"
# elsif variable == 99
#   puts "99"
# else
#   puts "0"
# end
# 9. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero and the second number is greater than 0, and prints 0 otherwise.
# variable1 = 3
# variable2 = 3
# if variable1 < 0 && variable2 > 0
#   puts "1"
# else
#   puts "0"
# end

# 10. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only 8 print statement should occur).
# variable = 5
# if variable > 80
#   puts "5"
# elsif variable > 60
#   puts "4"
# elsif variable > 40
#   puts "3"
# elsif variable > 20
#   puts "2"
# else
#   puts "1"
