# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
# first_name = "Kelly"
# last_name = "Barkhurst"
# puts first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# first_name = "Kelly"
# last_name = "Barkhurst"
# puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".
# puts "Input a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   puts "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).
# color1 = "red"
# color2 = "yellow"
# color3 = "orange"
# puts "The colors you chose are: " + color1 + "," + color2 + "," + color3 + "."

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."
# puts "Type in a name"
# name = gets.chomp.downcase
# if name != "santa"
#   puts "You're not Santa"

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
# book_title = "Gone With the Wind"
# book_author = "Margaret Mitchell"
# puts book_title + " is written by " + book_author + "."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"
# puts "Enter a password"
# password = gets.chomp.downcase
# if password != "joshua"

# city1 = "morgantown"
# city2 = "chicago"
# city3 = "nashville"
# puts "There are three cities: " + city1.capitalize + ", " + city2.capitalize + ", and " + city3.capitalize + "."
